# Part 0: Hello, world!

I have always found the ‘green field’ development to be exciting. There’s a certain thrill that comes with using a new language, framework, or other paradigm to push that first blinking bit of information through the its desired place. Even if it’s just a simple reply in the console, it brings a special feeling into my heart. It isn’t accomplishment - that’s for when things are finished, after all - but a sense of mutual understanding. The code and me are starting to get along, we’ve formed a bond of friendship that can be built upon through iteration and exploration. Before this first step, the computer is inert, dark, a blank face that inspired no confidence. Will magic spell, this incantation of random symbols really make something happen? Once you’ve got Hello, World, there’s very few situations you’ll find yourself in that can’t be thought through in a rational way. And that means it’s time to sally forth, to start leveraging that small wedge of simple understanding to chip away at the marble and sculpt something beautiful. 


This year, I am redoing my personal/professional website to better reflect the latest trajectory of the last few years. I have unfortunately had to put some projects on hold (specifically those in Augmented Reality) in favor of more mature technologies. I also realize that I have a great deal of valuable knowledge related to systems architecture and modern front-end practices that isn’t documented anywhere. Most of my jobs for the past 5 years have involve me making bold proclamations about how we can use X or Y technology to address the common problems of teams making web applications, and while nothing in this sphere of knowledge is eternal, there are some lessons I’ve learned and some patterns that suggest themselves. 

My ultimate goals are threefold: 

* Lower the barrier to entry for people who want to contribute to the web, 
* Demystify the workings of modern applications, algorithms and other nebulous tech
* Provide an example of how I think a small team (or even one person) can efficiently use the internet as a platform


## Background


I have always been fascinated by the internet. Since I didn’t have a windows PC, video games were scarce and so I spent a large, probably unhealthy amount of time on various forums. While other kids were playing sports, I was learning how to parse HTML to pick apart neopets. Nonetheless, my understanding was very crude, and I always sensed that I was only seeing the facade of a website, missing out on all the complex inner workings that would actually explain how things worked.

When I first studied computer science in college, I had very few points of reference of what I could actually DO. I knew the languages, sure, and I could do things like write a matching algorithm in python use Java to make a simple Asteroids clone. But outside of the world-broadening effect of a humanities education (hello, creative writing double major) I wasn’t really able to reckon with what a single person in front of a keyboard could make happen. My professors told us that the assignments we did were more like ’toy’ programs, rather than real-world solutions.

I’ll never forget the first peek behind the curtain, which was when I was interviewing with companies under the Turing Fellowship. We had been flown into NYC and interviewed with a handful of ‘hot’ startups. One company I was interested in was bit.ly, a link shortening service I often used. I sat down with Jehiah and Matt, two extremely smart guys who were friendly and kind to a greenhorn. They explained that bit.ly was, more than just a way to make links shorter, it was a way of tracking all of the activity going through their servers. I said ‘wow, wouldn’t it be cool if you were able to track all of those clicks, and do some analysis?’ At this, Jehiah smiled, explaining that yes, they kept track of every click, where it came from both geographically and in terms of prior URL, and that Bitly was so prominent that they captured roughly two percent of the clicks on links on the internet. My jaw dropped, and a universe of possibilities starting pouring into my mind.

I was lucky enough to land that first internship at bit.ly, and now, a good decade later, I have built systems and interfaces to serve hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions of users across big data, advertising, healthcare, logistics, education, and more. What I’ve learned is that even a small amount of information - two percent - can have an incredible impact on the decisions people make. From deciding what ad campaign to run, to suggesting a patient for mental health treatment, to routing a trucker between stops more efficiently so they can save fuel and be home with their family by the weekend, I’ve seen how technology produces better outcomes. The best thing, to me, is that this comes not just by hard work - once the initial work of making a scalable system is done, the desire of the people using the software to do their jobs better drives mass adoption and revolutions in how society functions.

To be sure, these changes are fraught with challenges, and the natural response of any individual who finds themselves in a massive impersonal system is ‘this machine can’t actually care about me, what if I fall through the cracks?’ But to me, this where we can leverage personal computing devices and a new generation of best practices. My favorite work has always been systems that help save people from this, whether it’s helping to detect financial crime, or ensuring vulnerable patients get the care they need.

All this is to say that I hope in my lifetime we can utilize the internet to serve people, not the other way around. The image of HAL 9000 staring with a single unblinking eye is a metaphor for what we used to build. On the other end of the spectrum, no developer wants to feel like the only result of their work is a platform for the distraction of silly cat videos or addictive games, the sad glazed-eye doom-scrolling many of us have fallen pretty to. Somewhere in between, there’s a sweet spot where computers  help us enjoy more of life, without replacing it. I believe we can, in the next few crucial decades, re-orient our discussion of technology to this viewpoint. If we do so, then we will escape the dystopian futures on either side and truly unlock human potential.
